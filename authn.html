<section id='abstract'>
        <p>We describe a mechanism which combines eIDAS X.509 certificates issued by QTSPs, advanced or qualified signatures and seals, and Verifiable Credentials to enable Decentralised Identity and Access Management (DIAM) in B2B ecosystems where it is required a high level of legal certainty, reduced manual processes and reduced dependency in third parties for the operation of the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>The mechanism enables authentication and access control of <b>entities acting on behalf of a legal person</b> with much more descriptive power and flexibility than trying to use just X.509 certificates of representation, and in a more efficient and automated way than using just signed PDFs.
        </p>
        <p>The mechanism is aligned with the upcoming EDIW (European Digital Identity Wallet) and its supporting eIDAS2 regulation, but it advances the state of the art by focusing entirely on legal persons. The mechanism can <b>not</b> be used for natural persons, but for legal persons there is no need to wait for future regulation and it can be implemented today.
        </p>
        <p>The mechanism leverages Verifiable Credentials and the existing eIDAS framework by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>making the credential a <b>machine-readable e-mandate</b> by embedding authorisation information in the credential using a formal language and binding it to the identities of the issuer and subject.
            </li>
            <li>making the credential a <b>legally binding document</b> under the [[eIDAS]] framework, by signing the credential with an advanced or qualified seal/signature.
            </li>
            <li>making the credential an <b>authentication mechanism</b>, by binding the identities of the subject and holder of the credential so it can be used for authentication.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this way, the credential is a <b>legally binding machine-readable document where the issuer attests that it delegates the set of powers specified in the credential to the user identified as the subject of the credential</b>.
        </p>
        <p>The subject can then <b>use the credential to authenticate to a Relying Party</b> because the identities of holder and subject are bound.
        </p>
        <p>This mechanism leverages the eIDAS trust framework using advanced or qualified signatures and seals to provide a <b>high level of legal certainty and enjoying the presumption of non-repudiation in the courts</b>, something that does not happen when using other types of basic signatures.
        </p>

    <section id='Problem Statement'><h2>Problem Statement</h2>

        <p>Representation powers and mandates are an essential element for businesses establishing relationships with other businesses, governments and customers, because in many cases natural persons act on behalf of legal persons and depending on the sensitivity of the involved data/processes the Relying Party wants to enforce a high level of compliance and reduce associated legal risks.
        </p>
        <p>The "traditional" way to solve this is by using manual processes and paper/PDF documents associated to onboarding and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes, that the Relying Party verifies until it is satisfied with the level of legal risk assumed when allowing a Principal to access some services on behalf of the Participant. Those setup processes are normally cumbersome, slow and people-intensive, creating a lot of friction in the initial stages of using a service, especially when strong identification is required by the nature of the service.
        </p>
        <p>Verifiable Credentials can become a good instrument to migrate those paper/PDF documents to a machine-readable and legally-binding format and streamline and automate most of the tasks in this area, making the whole process more efficient while maintaining the same level of compliance and legal risk than with traditional processes.
        </p>
        <p>Electronic powers of representation and mandates are an <b>explicit objective of the European Digital Identity Wallet</b> (EDIW) and the proposed amendment to eIDAS to support it:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>To achieve simplification and cost reduction benefits to persons and businesses across the Union, including by enabling <b>powers of representation and e-mandates</b>, Member States should issue EDIWs relying on common standards and technical specifications to ensure seamless interoperability and to adequately increase the IT security, strengthen robustness against cyber-attacks and thus significantly reduce the potential risks of ongoing digitalisation for citizens and businesses.
            </p>
            <figcaption>—[[[eIDAS2.Regulation]]]
            </figcaption>
        </blockquote>
        <p>However, currently there are important barriers that hinder the adoption of an EU wide solution for cross-border transfer of representation information, being one of the most relevant the <b>lack of a common semantic framework</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Representation is complex, and electronic mandates schemes and policies are basically national and usually do not contemplate the possibility to use those mandates in cross-border scenarios. The problem of mandates when accessing services from a Public Administration is extremely complex, so we will focus here on the private sector: when both the Relying Party and the Participant are legal persons from the private sector.
        </p>
        <p>In order to have a usable mechanism using Verifiable Credentials, the main requirements are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li id='REQ-01'><b>REQ-01</b>: <b>The credential is an e-mandate</b>, by embedding authorisation information in the credential and binding it to the identities of the issuer and subject. We call such a credential a <code>Verifiable Authorisation</code>.
                <p>We need to define a controlled vocabulary that can be used to express in a formal language (e.g. ODRL) the semantics of the powers delegated to a Principal by the Participant.
                </p>
            </li>

    <section id='Introduction'><h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>In a typical B2B ecosystem, the agreements between a product/service provider and the consumer are formalised among legal persons (also known in this document as 'organisations').
        </p>
        <p>However, when interacting in the context of execution of the agreement, typically other entities are acting on behalf of the legal persons both for the consumer organisation and for the service provider organisation.
        </p>
        <p>For example, an employee of the consumer organisation may start on behalf of his employer an interaction with the provider organisation to perform a process needed for the provision of a service. In this case, the provider organisation should authenticate the natural person and apply appropriate access control policies to ensure that the natural person is really entitled by the consumer organisation to perform the intended process.
        </p>
        <p>In the context of authentication and access management, the legal entity acting as consumer organisation will be named <code>Participant</code>. The digital representation of a natural person, acting on behalf of a Participant, is referred to as a <code>Principal</code>. However, when the context is clear and we need to refer to eIDAS legal terms, we will use the term <code>user</code> (defined in the Glossary) to denote a natural or legal person, or a natural person representing a legal person using a wallet to authenticate.
        </p>
        <p>The legal entity acting as service provider and performing authentication and access management will be called <code>Relying Party</code>.
        </p>
        <p>The approach is similar to the on-behalf-of actor model described in [[Actor-DataSpaces]] but our focus is on the compliance with the eIDAS legal framework to enable not only Data Spaces but any type of ecosystem to leverage the eIDAS trust framework and achieve a high level of legal certainty with the presumption of non-repudiation in the courts.
        </p>
        <p>The mechanism described here allows a Relying Party receiving a Verifiable Credential from a principal engaging in an authentication process to perform the following verifications:
        </p>
        <table class='deftable'>
            <tr><td style='padding-left: 0px;'><b>Authentication</b></td></tr><tr><td style='padding-left: 20px;'>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Non-tampering</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the credential was not tampered with since it was generated, thanks to the digital signature of the credential.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Binding the Principal with the subject inside the credential</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the principal presenting the credential is the same principal identified as the subject inside the credential by using the cryptographic material inside the credential that was embedded in a secure and private way during the credential issuance process. See section <a href="#verifiable_id" class="xref">Authentication requires a VerifiableID</a> for more details.
                        <div>
                        <p>The degree of trust in this verification depends on the degree of trust that the Relying Party puts on the processes that the Participant uses to issue the credentials.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>However, as described below, the usage of eIDAS signatures to sign the credential makes the Participant legally liable for any problems in the binding of the identities of the holder and subject of the credential. Specifically, compliance to the eIDAS specifications and regulation for electronic seals and signatures provides <b>presumption of non-repudiation and the burden of disputing it in the courts rests on the Participant, not on the Relying Party</b>.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>This is important because it provides the incentives in the proper places: the Participant is incentivised to create the credential in the proper way, and the Relying Party is incentivised to perform its due diligence in verifying the credential. By using the eIDAS signatures, no party has to assume the burden if the technical validity of the signature is disputed in court. Only the contents of the credential can be under discussion. See section <a href="#signature_benefits" class="xref">Signature of the Verifiable Credentials</a> for more details.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>In the mechanism described here, the verification is enabled by embedding inside the credential a public key corresponding to a private key that was generated by the principal during the issuance process. See below for the details, including an optional mechanism by embedding an existing eIDAS certificate issued by a QTSP when the principal is a natural person or a legal person (different from the Participant).
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Binding of issuer with a real-world identity</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the credential was issued by somebody controlling a private key associated to a given real-world identity.
                        <div>
                        <p>The verification is enabled because the Verifiable Credential is sealed with an eIDAS <a href="#qualified certificate for electronic seal" class="xref">qualified certificate for electronic seal</a> issued to the Participant by a <a href="#qualified trust service provider" class="xref">qualified trust service provider</a> (QTSP) in the [[[EU_Trusted_Lists]]], and the signature of the credential is an advanced or qualified electronic signature using the [[JAdES]] format (JSON Advanced Electronic Signature) as defined in the eIDAS regulation.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Of course, we also support electronic signatures with qualified certificates for electronic signatures issued by QTSPs to <b>natural persons acting as representatives of legal persons</b>.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>This verification ensures that an organisation with a real-world legal identity under the eIDAS Trust Framework has signed the credential being presented by a natural person identified as the subject of the credential.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>This verification <b>does not say anything about whether the organisation is a participant</b> in a given Data Space or not. See next point for such verification.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Verify that the real-world identity is a Participant</b>. The Relying Party, using the unique identifier in the eIDAS certificate used to sign the credential, can check if the issuer of the credential is a participant in a given ecosystem by looking for that unique identifier in the Trusted Participant List managed by that ecosystem.
                        <div>
                        <p>This unique identifier is the unique <code>organizationIdentifier</code> defined in [[[ETSI-LEGALPERSON]]], which is inside the certificates for legal persons and certificates for natural persons acting as representatives of legal persons.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Any legal person that can already engage in electronic transactions in the internal market can have an eIDAS certificate including such a unique identifier, which is used in all types of legally-binding signatures like invoices, contracts, etc.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>We assume here that the onboarding process of each ecosystem does not invent a new "local-only" identifier but uses the one that is already valid for electronic transactions in the internal market. Or at least, that the global eIDAS unique identifier is associated with whatever private identifier is invented by the ecosystem.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>We assume that the eIDAS unique identifier is used during onboarding to update a given Trusted Participant List with the identity of the new participant. That identity is composed of the unique identifier in the eIDAS framework and any additional attributes that may be relevant for the ecosystem. See below for the structure of the unique eIDAS identifier.
                        </p>
                        </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Binding the Participant to the delegated powers to the Principal</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the legal person (the Participant) or a representative of the legal person (in eIDAS terms) has delegated a specific set of powers to the subject identified inside the credential (who is the same person holding and presenting the credential, as described above in 'authentication').
                        <div>
                        <p>This is enabled because the credential includes a <b>set of claims that state in a formal language the delegated powers</b>, and the credential has been sealed/signed using an eIDAS certificate using the eIDAS advanced/qualified electronic signature format, described in more detail later in this document.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Alternatively, the credential can include a pointer to an external document (which could be another credential) describing in detail the delegated powers. In this case, the linking mechanism should provide a tamper-evident mechanism to avoid undetected modifications to the original external document, for example using [[Cryptographic Hyperlinks]].
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Thanks to the usage of eIDAS signatures, the credential is effectively a legal document with the same legal validity as any other document in any format supported by the eIDAS signature scheme. The Relying Party can verify (and prove in court if needed) with a high level of legal certainty that the legal person issuing the credential (the Participant) has declared that the holder/subject of the credential has the powers stated inside the credential (or linked by the credential).
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Actually, the entity identified as a subject in the credential, and that is receiving the delegated powers, is not restricted to be a natural person and can be of different types. Anything that can be expressed in paper or PDF format can be also expressed in the Verifiable Credential format. For example, it can be an employee, a customer or a machine or device under the responsibility of the legal person signing the credential.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Relying Party can use the claims mentioned above, expressed as a formal language (e.g. [[ODRL]]), to perform access control. The specific mechanism is not in the scope of this document.
                        <div>
                        <p>For example, the credential can just specify the role(s) of the entity identified in the credential (e.g. 'finance administrator' for an employee, 'gold customer' for a customer, 'humidity sensor' for a machine) and the Relying Party can evaluate a set of arbitrarily complex policy rules associated to the role(s) for access control.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Alternatively, the credential could specify more complex rules which the Relying Party can combine if needed with additional policy rules to make the final decision.
                        </p>
                        </div>

            </td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>To achieve all of the above, we define specific types of Verifiable Credentials with a format and a mechanism which specify:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>a way to sign the credentials;
            </li>
            <li>a way to bind the identity of the holder of a credential to the identity of the subject inside the credential;
            </li>
            <li>and a way to embed authorisation information in the credential describing the powers that the legal entity has delegated to the subject inside the credential.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The mechanisms described here can be used to generate credentials to employees, contractors, customers and even to machines and devices acting on behalf of an organisation. The schema is identical, except the issuance process is probably a little bit different and the roles and duties embedded in the credentials have different legal implications (but always in line with the legal framework, for example with the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/consumer-protection-law/consumer-contract-law/consumer-rights-directive_en#:~:text=About%20the%20directive,-The%20Consumer%20Rights&text=It%20aligns%20and%20harmonises%20national,they%20shop%20in%20the%20EU.">Consumer rights directive</a>).

                    <p>The mechanism provides <b>high legal predictability</b>, including for the qualified electronic signature the benefits of its <b>legal equivalence to handwritten signatures</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>As stated by the eIDAS Regulation, when a transaction requires a qualified electronic seal from a legal person, a qualified electronic signature from the authorised representative of the legal person should be equally acceptable.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is possible to certify elements that are bound to the signatory such as a title (e.g. Director), a link with its employer, etc. Because the QTSP is trusted for verifying the information it certifies, the Relying Party can get a high level of confidence in such information conveyed with the signature through the signatory's certificate.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this way, the Relying Party receiving Verifiable Credentials can have the same legal certainty than with any other document in other formats (e.g. PDF) signed with AdES or QES signatures or with handwritten signatures (in the case of QES).

                    <p>Any basic signature benefits from the non-discrimination rule, which means that a Court in an EU Member State cannot reject it automatically as being invalid simply because they are in electronic form.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, their dependability is lower than that of an AdES/AdESeal or QES/QESeal because the signatory may be required to prove the security of the technology being used if the validity of the signature is disputed before a court. This requires significant costs and efforts that could be avoided with relative ease by opting for the more established and standardised advanced and qualified signature solutions. It may also be the case that the relying parties have no applications or tools to validate such signature, when not based on standards; in such a scenario, the signature may be legally valid and technologically robust, but of limited use (see [[ENISA-Qualified Electronic Signatures]] and [[ENISA-Qualified Electronic Seals]]).
                    </p>
                    <p>For these interoperability reasons, QES/QESeal that are based on recognised EU standards are preferable unless the parties operate purely in a local context where the acceptance and usability of the chosen signature solution is sufficiently certain.
                    </p>
                    <p>Beyond the technical interoperability, the eIDAS Regulation also ensures the international recognition of electronic signatures, and not limited to the EU.

        <section id='verifiable_id'><h2>Authentication requires a VerifiableID</h2>

            <p>Not all types of Verifiable Credentials can be used as a mechanism for online authentication, because the Relying Party (the entity receiving the Verifiable Credential in an authentication process) needs to bind the identity of the user sending the credential to the claims attested about the subject inside the credential.
            </p>
            <p>For example, in the case of a Diploma as a Verifiable Credential (a Verifiable Diploma), the credential is a Verifiable Attestation which indicates that the subject has certain skills or has achieved certain learning outcomes through formal or non-formal learning context. However, as in the case with normal Diplomas in paper of PDF format, this credential can be presented by anyone that holds the credential. In other words, the credential binds the identity of the subject with the claims inside the credential, but does not bind the identity of the holder of the credential with the identity of the subject of the credential, which requires a special mechanism in the issuance process.
            </p>
            <p>Most Verifiable Credentials will be issued as Verifiable Attestations, acting as efficient machine-processable and verifiable equivalent to their analog counterparts. Their purpose is to attest some attributes about the subject of the credential and not act as a mechanism for online authentication.
            </p>
            <p>Instead, <b>a <code>VerifiableID</code> is a special form of a Verifiable Credential that a natural or legal person can use in an electronic identification process as evidence of whom he/she/it is</b> (comparable with a passport, physical IDcard, driving licence, social security card, member-card…).
            </p>
            <p>VerifiableIDs can be of different types and be issued by different entities with different levels of assurance (in eIDAS terminology). They are issued with the purpose of serving as authentication mechanisms in online processes. In the near future, VerifiableIDs of the highest level of assurance (LoA High) will be issued to citizens and businesses by their governments under eIDAS2.
            </p>
            <p>We describe in this document a way to issue VerifiableID credentials and how a Relying Party can perform authentication by accepting that credential.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='Access Control requires a Verifiable Authorisation'><h2>Access Control requires a Verifiable Authorisation</h2>

            <p>Once the user is authenticated, the system should make a decision to grant or reject an access request to a protected resource from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorised to access.
            </p>
            <p>Let's take the example of when a Service Provider signs an agreement with a Service Consumer organisation (a legal person), and the Service Provider wants to allow access to some services to employees of the Consumer organisation under the conditions of the agreement.
            </p>
            <p>In most cases, granting access is not an all-or-nothing decision. In general, the agreement between the Service Provider and Service Consumer specifies that only a subset of the employees of the Consumer organisation can access the services, and even in that subset not all employees have the same powers when accessing the services. For example, some employees have access to the administration of the service, some can perform some create/update/delete operations in a subset of the services, and some employees can only have read access to a subset of the services.
            </p>
            <p>To allow for this granularity in an authentication and access control process, in general the entity willing to perform an action on a protected resource has to present (in a Verifiable Presentation) a VerifiableID and possibly one or more additional Verifiable Attestations.
            </p>
            <p>At least one of the credentials should include claims identifying the employee (or any other subject) and a formal description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation, enabling the determination by the Service Provider whether the user is entitled to access a service and the operations that the user can perform on that service.
            </p>
            <p>We define later a standard mechanism and format for a Verifiable Credential that enables this functionality in a simple, secure and with high degree of legal certainty compatible with eIDAS.
            </p>
            <p>Such a credential is called a Verifiable Authorization, represented in the figure above.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='Combining VerifiableID and Verifiable Authorisation in the LEARCredential'><h2>Combining VerifiableID and Verifiable Authorisation in the LEARCredential</h2>

            <p>In many use cases, it is possible to simplify the authentication and access control by combining in a single credential both a VerifiableID (for authentication) and a Verifiable Authorisation (for access control).
            </p>
            <p>We call the resulting credential a LEARCredential and it is very useful when the holder/subject wants to use a decentralised IAM mechanisms implemented by Relying Parties which are federated in a decentralised way using a common Trust Anchor Framework.
            </p>
            <p>We repeat here the taxonomy diagram to facilitate the description of the LEARCredential.
            </p>

            <figcaption>The LEARCredential</figcaption></figure>

            <p>The subject identified in the credential can authenticate to perform a protected process by using a special type of Verifiable Credential called <code>LEARCredential</code> (from <b>L</b>egal <b>E</b>ntity <b>A</b>uthorised <b>R</b>epresentation).
            </p>
            <p>To achieve a high level of legal certainty under eIDAS, the LEARCredential is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>signed or sealed with an eIDAS certificate which is either:
                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a <b>certificate for electronic seals</b> issued to a legal person by a <a href="#qualified trust service provider" class="xref">qualified trust service provider</a>, or
                        </li>
                        <li>a <b>certificate for electronic signatures</b>, issued to a <b>legal representative of the legal person</b> by a qualified trust service provider.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>signed using the <b>JSON Advanced Electronic Signature</b> format described in [[[JAdES]]]
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The LEARCredential includes claims identifying the subject of the credential and a description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.
            </p>
            <p>By signing/sealing the credential with an eIDAS certificate, the legal representative attests that the powers described in the credential have been delegated to the subject (maybe under some conditions, also described in the credential).
            </p>
            <p>In this way, the LEARCredential has the same legal status as any other document in other formats (e.g., PDF) signed in an eIDAS-compliant way, but with all the advantages provided by the Verifiable Credential format.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, the LEARCredential includes cryptographic material that allows the subject of the credential to <b>use the credential as an online authentication mechanism</b> in a portal or API, by proving that the holder of the credential is the same entity identified in the credential.
            </p>
            <p>Any Verifier that trusts the eIDAS Trust Framework will be able to verify that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The entity presenting the LEARCredential (the holder) is the same as the one identified in the subject of the credential</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>A legal representative of the organisation has attested that the subject has the powers described in the credential</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This enables the entity presenting the LEARCredential to start the process and to provide any additional required documentation as additional Verifiable Credentials to enable automatic verification of compliance with the process requirements (including Gaia-X credentials issued by the Compliance Service of Gaia-X).
            </p>
            <p>Both types of eIDAS certificates mentioned above are an electronic attestation <b>that links electronic seal/signature validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person</b>. This way, the certificate, usually linked to the sealed/signed document, can be used to verify the identity of the creator of the seal/signature and whether the document has been sealed/signed using the corresponding private key.
            </p>
            <p>Before issuing a certificate like the above, the qualified trust service provider (QTSP) performs validations against <code>Authentic Sources</code> to authenticate the identity of the organisation under the eIDAS framework:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The data concerning the business name or corporate name of the organisation.
                </li>
                <li>The data relating to the constitution and legal status of the subscriber.
                </li>
                <li>The data concerning the extent and validity of the powers of representation of the applicant.
                </li>
                <li>The data concerning the tax identification code of the organisation or equivalent code used in the country to whose legislation the subscriber is subject.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The person controlling the above certificates can authorise a subject to perform some operations on behalf of the organisation (LEAR) by generating and signing a Verifiable Credential which:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Includes identification data of a subject
                </li>
                <li>Includes claims stating the delegation of specific powers to perform a set of specific processes on behalf of the organisation
                </li>
                <li>Includes a public key where the corresponding private key is controlled by the subject, enabling the subject to prove that she/he/it is the holder of the credential when it is being used in an authentication process like the ones used as examples in this document.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The LEARCredential uses the <code>did:elsi</code> method for the identifiers of legal persons involved in the process, to facilitate the DID resolution and linkage with the eIDAS certificates. The <code>did:elsi</code> method is specified in [[[DID-ELSI]]]. But any other suitable DID method can be used is desired.
            </p>
            <p>The high-level view of the process is described in the following diagram, using as an example a COO (Chief Operating Officer) acting a legal entity representative and appointing an employee to perform some processes:
            </p>

        </section>
    </section>
    <section id='The LEARCredential through an example'><h2>The LEARCredential through an example</h2>

        <p>In this section we describe in detail the LEARCredential and for illustrative purpose we use example attributes from a fictitious ecosystem whose participants are described in Appendix <a href="#participants" class="xref">Example scenario: Participants in the ecosystem</a>.
        </p>
        <p>In this example the LEARCredential will be generated using the eIDAS certificate of the COO (Chief Operation Officer) of the organisation that will be issuing the credential.
        </p>
        <p>The credential will be generated with an application that the COO will use as Issuer of the LEARCredential and that allows the employee to receive the credential using his credential wallet, using [[OpenID.VCI]] to achieve compliance with the EUDI Wallet ARF.
        </p>
        <p>This application enables the COO to attest the information required to create the LEARCredential, specifying the employee information and the specific type of LEARCredential. In general, there may be different instances of LEARCredentials for different purposes. One employee can have more than one LEARCredential, each having a different delegation of powers for different environments.
        </p>
        <p>The specific detailed use case here is the issuance of a LEARCredential to an employee to enable that employee to perform the onboarding process in an ecosystem. But exactly the same process with different attested attributes can be used by any organisation to issue credentials that can be accepted by other organisations for authentication and access control to any protected resources that they manage.
        </p>
        <p>The essential components of a LEARCredential are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Claims identifying the employee</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>DID of the employee to enable authentication</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Claims identifying the legal representative</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>The roles and duties of the LEAR</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Advanced/Qualified signature of the credential</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concepts are elaborated in the following sections.
        </p>
        <section id='Claims identifying the employee'><h2>Claims identifying the employee</h2>

            <p>These are claims identifying the subject of the credential, the person who will act as LEAR. Each ecosystem can define their own depending on their specific requirements.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, each organisation can specify their own for enabling access to its products/services. However, it is recommended to use a set of claims that are agreed upon by all participants in the ecosystem unless there are specific requirements for not doing so. This includes not only the amount of claims but also their syntax and semantics.
            </p>
            <p>For our example, we use the same that are used for accessing the European Commission portal. The claims in the credential are the digital equivalent of their analog counterparts, displayed here for illustration.

</pre></td></tr></table>

        </section>
        <section id='DID of the employee'><h2>DID of the employee</h2>

            <p>In this example we use the <code>did:key</code> method for the DID of the employee, which provides a very high level of privacy and given the way the LEARCredential is generated it supports the verification of the chain of responsibility with a proper level of guarantee.
            </p>
            <p>If the highest levels of assurance and legal compliance is desired and the employee has an eIDAS certificate for signatures (in this case a personal one, not one like the COO), we could use the <code>elsi:did</code> method for identification of the employee. However, the organisation (GoodAir in our example) should make sure that the employee is aware of and agree to the possible privacy implications of doing so, given the personal details leaked from the eIDAS certificate.
            </p>
            <p>Those personal details are exactly the same as if the employee signs any document with a digital certificate, but care should be taken by the organisation because in this case the signature would be done "on behalf of" his employer and not as an individual personal action.
            </p>
            <p>Even though this is not unique to the <code>did:elsi</code> method, this also implies that the onboarding service has to handle those personal details in the same way as if it would be accepting any other document signed with a certificate for signatures, and ensure compliance with GDPR. This is "business as usual" when using digital signatures, but we want to make sure that this is taken care of when implementing the authentication and access control mechanisms described here.
            </p>
            <p>In this example we assume the usage of the <code>did:key</code> method for the employee to protect his privacy as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>This DID for the employee is an additional claim to the ones presented above, using the <code>id</code> field in the <code>credentialSubject</code> object.
            </p>
            <p>Using this DID method has an additional advantage: the DID identifier corresponds to a keypair that is generated during the LEARCredential issuance process, where the private key is generated by the wallet of the employee and it is always under his control.
            </p>
            <p>This private key controlled by the employee can be used to sign challenges from Relying Parties that receive the credential to prove that the person sending the credential is the same person that is identified in the <code>credentialSubject</code> object of the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <p>It is this property that makes this credential a VerifiableID that can be used for online authentication.
            </p>
            <p>An example DID for the employee could be:
            </p>

<table style="width:100%;"><tr><td class="codecolor">
<pre class='nohighlight precolor'>
{
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK&#34;</span>
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

            <p>In this example, the signatures performed with the private key can not be JAdES-compliant ([[JAdES]]), but if the LEARCredential is attached to any other credential that is signed with this private key, then they can be traced up to the eIDAS certificate of the COO and so the chain of responsibility can be determined..
            </p>
            <p>With the DID for the employee, the set of claims identifying him would be then:

        <section id='Roles and Duties of the LEAR'><h2>Roles and Duties of the LEAR</h2>

            <p>The LEARCredential should include a formal description with the roles and duties of the LEAR. This is the digital equivalent to the analog description in our example, which uses natural language:
            </p>
            <figure id='lear-appointment-letter-2'>
                <p><img src="images/lear-appointment-letter-2.png" alt="" />

            </figure>
            <table style='width:100%;'><tr><td class='xnotet'><aside class='xnotea'>

                <p>We do not yet have defined the actual mechanism that will be used for describing formally the roles and duties of the LEAR. The way we specify them below is just an example. There is work ongoing to define the detailed mechanism formally (e.g. with ODRL), and it is expected to change. This example is intended only to describe the concepts in detail.
                </p>
            </aside></td></tr></table>
            <p>The <code>rolesAndDuties</code> object points to an externally hosted object with the roles and duties of the LEAR. This external object can be either a machine-interpretable definition of the roles and duties in the credential, or just an external definition of the roles and duties in natural language. The ideal approach is the first option, expressing the semantics with a proper machine-readable language, because this will allow automatic access control at the granularity of the individual sentences of that expression language. The <code>rolesAndDuties</code> object can also have the definition embedded into it, instead of having a pointer to an external object.
            </p>
            <p>A simplistic implementation of the object inside the credential could be:

            <p>In the above example, we have specified that the roles object referenced in the credential with <code>id: https://dome-marketplace.eu//lear/v1/6484994n4r9e990494</code> is granting the employee of GoodAir (in our example) to access services in the DOME marketplace (specified with the field <code>target</code>) with the roles <code>seller</code> and <code>customer</code> (which are the roles of the <a href="https://business-api-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">FIWARE BAE component</a>).
            </p>
            <p>If <code>target</code> is omitted, the roles would apply to any target organisation. If we need to specify more than one target organisation, the array should include as many objects as required.

        <section id='Overview'><h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>In this example we use what we call a <i>profile</i> of the [[OpenID.VCI]] protocol. The standard is very flexible, and we restrict the different options available in the standard and implement a set of the options with given values that are adequate for our use case, without impacting flexibility in practice.
            </p>
            <p>The following figure describes the main components that interact in the issuance of a credential in this profile.
            </p>
            <p>The description of the issuance process is general enough to be used for many types of credentials, but the text includes notes describing the concrete application of the process to the case of the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <figure id='iss-overview'>

                <figcaption>Overview of participants.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><b>End user</b>
            </p>
            <p>This profile is valid for both natural and juridical persons, but because we are focusing on the issuance of the LEARCredential, in the detailed examples below we assume a natural person as the user.
            </p>
            <p><b>Wallet</b>
            </p>
            <p>The wallet is assumed to be a Web application with a wallet backend, maybe implemented as a PWA so it has some offline capabilities and can be installed in the device, providing a user experience similar to a native application. Private key management and most sensitive operations are performed in a backend server, operated by an entity trusted by the end user. Other profiles can support native and completely offline PWA mobile applications, for end users.
            </p>
            <p>This type of wallet supports natural persons, juridical persons and natural persons who are legal entity representatives of juridical persons. For juridical persons the wallet is usually called an <code>enterprise wallet</code> but we will use here just the term <code>wallet</code> unless the distinction is required.
            </p>
            <p>In this profile we assume that the wallet is not previously registered with the Issuer and that the wallet does not expose public endpoints that are called by the Issuer, even if the wallet has a backend server that could implement those endpoints. That makes the wallet implementations in this profile to be very similar in interactions to a full mobile implementation, making migration to a full mobile implementation easier.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, from the point of view of the Issuer, the wallet in this profile is almost indistinguishable from a full mobile wallet.
            </p>
            <p><b>User Laptop</b>
            </p>
            <p>For clarity of exposition, we assume in this profile that the End User starts the interactions with the Issuer with an internet browser (user agent) in her laptop. However, there is nothing in the interactions which limits those interactions to a laptop form factor and the End User can interact with any internet browser in any device (mobile, tablet, kiosk).
            </p>
            <p><b>Issuer</b>
            </p>
            <p>In this profile we assume that the Issuer is composed of two components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Authorization server</b>: the backend component implementing the existing authentication/authorization functionalities for the Issuer entity.
                </li>
                <li><b>Issuer backend</b>: the main server implementing the business logic as a web application and additional backend APIs required for issuance of credentials.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Issuer backend and the Authorization server could be implemented as a single component in an actual deployment, but we assume here that they are separated to make the profile more general, especially for big entities and also when using Trust Service Providers for cloud signature and credential issuance, for example.
            </p>
            <p><b>Authentication of End User and previous Issuer-End User relationship</b>
            </p>
            <p>We assume that the Issuer and End User have a previous relationship and that the Issuer has performed the KYC required by regulation and needed to be able to issue Verifiable Credentials attesting some attributes about the End User. We assume that there is an existing trusted authentication mechanism (not necessarily related to Verifiable Credentials) that the End User employs to access protected resources from the Issuer. For example, the user is an employee or a customer of the Issuer, or the Issuer is a Local Administration and the End User is a citizen living in that city.

            <p>Before requesting a new credential, the End User has to authenticate with the Issuer with whatever mechanism is already implemented by the Issuer. This profile does not require that it is based on OIDC, Verifiable Credentials or any other specific mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>The level of assurance (LoA) of this authentication mechanism is one of the factors that will determine the confidence that the Verifiers can have on the credentials received by them from a given Issuer.

                </p>
                <p>Being a modern company, GoodAir uses Verifiable Credentials IAM but this is not a requirement for the issuance of the LEARCredential.

            <p>In this profile the wallet does not have to implement the Credential Offer Endpoint described in section 4 of [[OpenID.VCI]].
            </p>
            <p>Instead, the Credential Issuer renders a QR code containing a reference to the Credential Offer that can be scanned by the End-User using a Wallet, as described in section 4.1 of [[OpenID.VCI]].
            </p>
            <p>According to the spec, the Credential Offer object is a JSON object containing the Credential Offer parameters and can be sent by value or by reference. To avoid problems with the size of the QR travelling in the URL, this profile requires that the QR contains the <code>credential_offer_uri</code>, which is a URL using the <code>https</code> scheme referencing a resource containing a JSON object with the Credential Offer parameters. The <code>credential_offer_uri</code> endpoint should be implemented by the Issuer backend.
            </p>
            <section id='Credential Offer Parameters'><h2>Credential Offer Parameters</h2>

                <p>This profile restricts the options available in section 4.1.1 of [[OpenID.VCI]]. The profile defines a Credential Offer object containing the following parameters:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>credential_issuer</code>: REQUIRED. The URL of the Credential Issuer that will be used by the Wallet to obtain one or more Credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>credentials</code>: REQUIRED. A JSON array, where every entry is a JSON string. To achieve interoperability faster, this profile defines a global Trusted Credential Schemas List where well-known credential schemas are defined, in addition to the individual credentials that each Issuer can define themselves. The string value MUST be one of the id values in one of the objects in the <code>credentials_supported</code> metadata parameter of the Trusted Credential Schemas List (described later), or one of the id values in one of the objects in the <code>credentials_supported</code> Credential Issuer metadata parameter provided by the Credential Issuer. When processing, the Wallet MUST resolve this string value to the respective object. The credentials defined in the global Trusted Credential Schema List have precedence over the ones defined by the Credential Issuer.

                    </li>
                    <li><code>grants</code>: REQUIRED. A JSON object indicating to the Wallet the Grant Type <code>pre-authorized_code</code>. This grant is represented by a key and an object, where the key is <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code</code>. In this profile the credential issuance flow requires initial authentication of the End User by the Credential Issuer, so the Pre-Authorized Code Flow achieves a good level of security and we do not need the more general Authorization Code Flow.
                        <div>
                        <p>In other scenarios like when the wallet is a native mobile application and the user interacts with the Issuer exclusively with the mobile (without the laptop), then the Authorization Code Flow has to be used. This can be described in detail in a different profile.

                <ul>
                    <li><code>pre-authorized_code</code>: REQUIRED. The code representing the Credential Issuer's authorization for the Wallet to obtain Credentials of a certain type. This code MUST be short lived and single-use. This parameter value MUST be included in the subsequent Token Request with the Pre-Authorized Code Flow.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>user_pin_required</code>: REQUIRED. The [[OpenID.VCI]] standard says it is RECOMMENDED, but this profile specifies the user pin to achieve a greater level of security. This field is a boolean value specifying whether the Credential Issuer expects presentation of a user PIN along with the Token Request in a Pre-Authorized Code Flow. Default is false. This PIN is intended to bind the Pre-Authorized Code to a certain transaction in order to prevent replay of this code by an attacker that, for example, scanned the QR code while standing behind the legit user. It is RECOMMENDED to send a PIN via a separate channel. The PIN value MUST be sent in the <code>user_pin</code> parameter with the respective Token Request.
                    </li>
                </ul>

This is the reason why the <code>kid</code> field above is exactly the DID identifier under this DID method. The <code>did:key</code> method is very simple and achieves a very high degree of privacy, allowing the creation of many different identifiers which can be one-use only if so desired.

    <section id='Authenticating with Verifiable Credentials'><h2>Authenticating with Verifiable Credentials</h2>

        <section id='Overview1135'><h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>Authentication requires a special type of Verifiable Credential called a VerifiableID. For the examples illustrating the mechanism we will use a LEARCredential, which is at the same time a VerifiableId and a Verifiable Authorization.
            </p>
            <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on [[[NIST-AUTH]]] which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve authentication and enforcement of the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.
            </p>
            <p>The diagram uses the logical concepts also used in the XACML reference architecture, but the description is agnostic to the actual policy language used in a concrete implementation.
            </p>
            <p>In this description we assume that the user is a natural person who wants to access a protected resource. However, the architecture supports machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. The differences will be described in the description when they are relevant.
            </p>
            <figure><img src='images/login_in_DOME/authn_architecture_numbered.drawio.png'/>
            <figcaption>Architecture overview</figcaption></figure>
            <p>The high level flow is the following:
            </p>
            <ul class='plain'>
                <li id='1'><b>1</b> The user sends a request to access a protected resource managed by the Relying Party.
                </li>
                <li id='2'><b>2</b> Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point). The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded only if they are accepted. If the request does not come with authentication information, there are several high level scenarios which are possible:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the user is a machine using an API, the request is rejected with an error. The caller is responsible for authenticating before retrying, which can be done using the metadata about the Relying Party available at the standard OpenID endpoints.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the user is a natural person using a browser for navigating the portal of the Relying Party, the typical approach is to redirect the browser to the authentication component using an HTTP Status of 302. The redirection includes enough information so the authentication component can send back the user to the original request if the user completes authentication successfully.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Alternatively, the request can include authentication information which has been obtained before via an authentication process. If this is the case, the PEP goes directly into the authentication phase, described later in section <a href="#accesscontrol" class="xref">Access control with Verifiable Credentials</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li id='3'><b>3</b> The user is redirected to the authentication component. As mentioned before, alternatively the authorization component can be accessed directly by the user before trying to access the protected resource. This would be the expected behaviour of a user who knows that authentication is required. The mechanism described here supports all possible scenarios both for natural persons and machines.
                    <p>An example flow with a natural person would be: The user navigates first to a general Login page in the portal of the Relying Party and authenticates. After authentication the portal presents a collection of services that the user can access. The user selects one of the services/operations and the Relying Party executes the operation if the user is authorised to do so.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li id='4'><b>4</b> The Verifiable Credentials verifier component of the Relying Party retrieves the credentials that are required for authentication. If the user has been redirected when trying to access a protected resource, the redirection provides information about the operation and protected resource that was trying to access, so there may be more credentials required than just a VerifiableID.
                    <p>If the user accessed the Login page directly, the VC Verifier component does not have information about the resource that the user intends to access, so it can request just a VerifiableID.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li id='5'><b>5</b> The VC Verifier component of the Relying Party and the Wallet of the user engage in a Verifiable Presentation Exchange flow, where the result is that the VC Verifier receives a VerifiableID and possibly additional Verifiable Credentials as determined in step 4.
                </li>
                <li id='6'><b>6</b> The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.
                    <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.
                    </p>
                    <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.
                    </p>
                    <p>For simplicity, the diagram below shows the query of the Trusted Issuer Lists as a single interaction to a single box, but the actual interactions can be very complex if required. In addition, the diagram does not specify whether the list is "private" or "global".
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following sections elaborate in more detail in each of the interactions.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='Starting the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow'><h2>Starting the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow</h2>

            <p>In this section we assume that the user tries to access a protected resource and that the user is not authenticated. The flow when the user is already authenticated is the same, just skipping the authentication phase (steps 1 to 6).
            </p>
            <p>The authentication process starts an OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification [[OpenID.SIOP2]], where the VC Verifier component of the portal plays the role of a Relying Party (RP in Open ID Connect terminology) and the wallet of the user is a Self-Issued IdP.
            </p>
            <p>In this step, the Verifier has to send an Authorization Request to the wallet. But as a Self-Issued OP may be running locally as a native application or progressive web application (PWA), the RP may not have a network-addressable endpoint to communicate directly with the OP. We have to leverage the implicit flow of OpenID Connect to communicate with such locally-running Ops, as described in [[OpenID.SIOP2]].
            </p>
            <p>We use a QR code to start the process and allow the wallet to receive the Authorization Request from the Verifier, and respond with an Authorization Response, sent to the Verifier in the body of an HTTP <code>POST</code> request.

            </p>
            <p>The parameters comprising a request for verifiable presentations are given in section 5 of [[OpenID.VP]] and in section 10.1 of [[OpenID.SIOP2]] and are reproduced here with the particularities of this use case, in particular taking into account that this is a cross-device interaction:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li id='response_type'><b>response_type</b> (REQUIRED). Must be <code>vp_token</code>. This parameter is defined in [[RFC6749]]. The possible values are determined by the response type registry established by [[RFC6749]]. The [[OpenID.VP]] specification introduces the response type <code>vp_token</code>. This response type asks the Wallet to return only a VP Token in the Authorization Response, which is what we want in our case.
                </li>
                <li id='scope'><b>scope</b> (REQUIRED). This parameter is defined in [[RFC6749]] which allows it to be used by verifiers to request presentation of credentials by utilizing a pre-defined scope value designating the type of credential. See section <a href="#request_scope" class="xref">Request Scope</a> for more details. We use in this instance the value <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> which means that the RP (DOME onboarding service) is asking the SIOP (user wallet) to send a credential of type <code>LEARCredential</code>.
                </li>
                <li id='response_mode'><b>response_mode</b> REQUIRED. MUST be <code>direct_post</code>. As this is a cross-device scenario, this response mode is used to instruct the Self-Issued OP to deliver the result of the authentication process to a certain endpoint using the HTTP POST method. This endpoint to which the SIOP shall deliver the authentication result is conveyed in the parameter <code>redirect_uri</code> described below.
                </li>
                <li id='redirect_uri'><b>redirect_uri</b> (REQUIRED). MUST be a valid RP endpoint. The Authentication Response is sent to this endpoint using <code>POST</code> and encoding <code>application/json</code>).
                </li>
                <li id='client_id'><b>client_id</b> REQUIRED. MUST be the DID of the RP (DOM onboarding entity) so it can be resolved by the SIOP and checked against a Trusted List, or rejected if it does not pass validation. This provides a high level of assurance to the SIOP that the RP is really who it claims.
                </li>
                <li id='client_id_scheme'><b>client_id_scheme</b> REQUIRED. MUST have the value <code>did</code>. This value indicates that the Client Identifier is a DID defined in [[DID-Core]]. The request MUST be signed with a private key associated with the DID. To obtain the corresponding private key, the Wallet MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method used by the Verifier. For most DID methods and since the associated DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the kid in the JOSE Header. However, in our case the Verifier uses <code>did:elsi</code> and so the request MUST be signed with the eIDAS certificate according to the [[JAdES]] format, which defines the mechanism to identify the public key.
                    <p>All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the client_metadata or the <code>client_metadata_uri parameter</code> as defined in Section 5 of [[OpenID.VP]].
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li id='nonce'><b>nonce</b> REQUIRED. This parameter follows the definition given in [[OpenID.Core]]. It is used to securely bind the verifiable presentation(s) provided by the wallet (SIOP) to the particular transaction managed by the RP.
                </li>
                <li id='state'><b>state</b> REQUIRED. Used by the portal component of DOM onboarding to associate the start of an authentication session with the end of that session when the RP Verifier component notifies to the portal.
                </li>
                <li id='presentation_definition'><b>presentation_definition</b> CONDITIONAL. A string containing a <code>presentation_definition</code> JSON object as defined in Section 4 of [[DIF.PresentationExchange]]. We do not use this parameter because <code>scope</code> already specifies the credential type.
                </li>
                <li id='presentation_definition_uri'><b>presentation_definition_uri</b> CONDITIONAL. A string containing a URL pointing to a resource where a <code>presentation_definition</code> JSON object as defined in Section 4 of [[DIF.PresentationExchange]] can be retrieved. We do not use this parameter because <code>scope</code> already specifies the credential type.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: A request MUST contain either a <code>presentation_definition</code> or a <code>presentation_definition_uri</code> or a single <code>scope</code> value representing a presentation definition, those three ways to request credential presentation are mutually exclusive. We use here the <code>scope</code> mechanism, which is simpler and fits our use case.
            </p>
            <p>This is an example request object using the definitions above:

            <ul class='plain'>
                <x-li id='10'> Verification of the signature. As mentioned in the previous section, the Authorization Request is received as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service. This allows the wallet to verify that the signature corresponds to a real-world entity.
<div>
</div>
                </li>
                <x-li id='11'> Verification that the DID in the `client_id` field of the Authorization Request corresponds to the entity that signed the Authorization Request. This is easy in our case because we use the `did:elsi` method.
<div>
</div>
                </li>
                <x-li id='12'> Verification that the entity identified in the `client_id` field of the Authorization Request is a trusted entity belonging to the ecosystem, by resolving the DID in the `client_id` field.
<div>
                    <p>The actual mechanism may vary depending on the DID method used and the ecosystem where the client wants to onboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>If the Relying Party is a well known entity (like the DOME onboarding service in the case of DOME), it is easy to verify that the DID corresponds to the Relying Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>In most other cases, for example when the Relying Party is a participant in the ecosystem, we assume that the ecosystem provides a Trusted Participants Registry with an API compatible with the EBSI Trusted Issuers Registry, and that the participants registry is managed in a trusted way by the onboarding service (meaning that the Wallet user trusts on the onboarding service, in the same way as all other participants).
                    </p>
                    <p>In this case, to check if the DID is a participant on the ecosystem, the wallet sends a <code>GET /api/did/v1/identifiers/{did-to-verify}</code> request to the endpoint of one of several trusted servers implementing the functionality to query the Trusted Participant Registry, where <code>{did-to-verify}</code> is the actual DID the Wallet wants to check (in our example it would be <code>did:elsi:VATFR-99999999</code>, corresponding to the RP) . The API returns a JSON document as a DID Document. The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owner of the DID. It contains its Public Key, used to verify the digital signature of the entity. It also contains the status of the entity in the ecosystem. It is extensible and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case. The API must be operated by a trusted entity for the Wallet user. There may be as many servers implementing the API as needed and operated by different entities. At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the Wallet of the user, to facilitate the use of the wallet.

            <p>This section assumes that authentication has already been performed and that the Relying Party receives a request to a protected resource, with a proper access token inside the request. If the request does not come with an access token, the request is rejected immediately (or the user is redirected to the Authentication service of the Relying Party, depending on the use case).
            </p>
            <p>The Access Control mechanism described here is the same independently of whether the request comes from a user or a machine, so the M2M use case is supported without any modification. In the following description we will use the term <b>user</b> interchangeably for both the user as a natural person or the user as a machine.
            </p>
            <p>However, the assumption is that all machines have an identity (they are assigned an identifier), and that they are acting <code>on behalf of</code> a legally valid identity in the sense of eIDAS2. In other words, we require that the identities of users and machines can be cryptographically bound to the real-world identity of either a natural person or a legal person in a way that provides legal certainty to the Relying Party regarding the chain of responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>If the user is a natural person using the portal of the Relying Party, the request to the protected resource will come from the browser that the user employs to navigate the portal, and the access token will be included automatically by the browser in every request that is sent to the Relying Party, for example when the user clicks a button or fills a form.
            </p>
            <p>If the user is a server or device, it is assumed that it has obtained an access token previously as the result of an authentication process described above. The server or device is responsible for including the access token in every request that is sent to the Relying Party to access a protected resource.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal of the Relying Party is an onboarding process (eg., the portal of the DOME Onboarding service), the protected resource could be the onboarding service itself, or a service to upload additional information for a partially completed onboarding process.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal is a Marketplace and the organisation using the portal wants to offer products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Seller</i>, or to create a Product specification and offering.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal is the Marketplace and the organisation wants to contract products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Customer</i>, or to launch a procurement order of a product.
            </p>
            <p>The same mechanism can be used by any participant in the ecosystem, if they want to use an advanced IAM mechanism which is aligned with the EU strategy on digital identity based on Verifiable Credential and eIDAS2.

            <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on [[[NIST-AUTH]]] which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve enforcement the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.

            <p>Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), and to know if the request should be authorised or not, the PEP asks to the PDP (Policy Decision Point) for a decision. The PDP needs to know what are the policy rules that should be applied to the request, and it uses the PRP (Policy Retrieval Point) to retrieve those policies.
            </p>

            <ul class='plain'>
                <x-li id='1'> The user (natural person or machine) sends a request to access a protected resource, and the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) component intercepts the call. The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded if they are accepted.
<div>
</div>
                </li>
                <x-li id='2'> If the request is not authenticated it is rejected with an error. Depending on the use case, the error returned can contain additional information that enables the user agent to be redirected to perform authentication.
<div>
                    <p>After inspecting the request, the PEP requests a decision from the PDP passing a series of attributes. In general, the request from the PEP to the PDP consists of <b>subject</b> attributes (typically for the user who issued the request), <b>resource</b> attributes (the resource for which access is sought), <b>action</b> attributes (the operations to be performed on the resource), and <b>environment</b> attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the above attributes are obtained by the PEP from the original request received from the user. For example, the HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the URL and possibly the body of the request provide action attributes. Specifically, in the case of an NGSI-LD request those attributes are formally specified in the NGSI-LD standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>The subject attributes most relevant for access control are located in the access token received with the request. In particular, the access token includes the Verifiable Credentials that were employed for authentication, and the claims in those credentials can be used to evaluate access control policies. This includes (but is not limited to) the roles object that may be included in the VerifiableID credential used for authentication.
                    </p>
                    <p>An example access token would be:

                    <p>Environmental attributes, which depend on the availability of system sensors that can detect and report values, are somewhat different from subject and resource attributes, which are administratively created. Environmental attributes are not properties of the subject or resources, but are measurable characteristics that pertain to the operational or situational context in which access requests occur. These environmental characteristics are subject and resource independent, and may include the current time, day of the week, or threat level.
                    </p>
                    <p>The PDP computes decisions to permit or deny subject requests to perform actions on resources. In computing a decision, the PDP queries policies stored in a PRP (Policy Retrieval Point).
                    </p>
                    <p>If the attributes of the request are not sufficient for rule and policy evaluation, the PDP may need to search the PIP for additional attributes. The PIP is shown as one logical store, but in fact may comprise multiple physical stores of different types.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to the PIP, the PDP uses one or more Trusted Issuers Lists (to check if the issuer of the credential is included in them as a trusted issuer of that type of credential), and also the Authorization Registry (AR), which can check for finer granularity authorisation records which may be very dynamic in nature (e.g. if some resource usage by employees and machines owned by the issuer have exceeded some quota this month).
                    </p>
                    <p>The actual Trusted Issuers Lists that the PDP needs to check is determined by the policy rules retrieved from the PRP. Those policy rules also determine the additional queries performed to the PIP data stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>The set of information and data stored in the PIP and PRP comprise the access control data and collectively define the current authorization state, which the PDP will use to compute its decision.

However, The PDP can be modularised in order to minimise the dependency and reduce the cost of migration to other policy language in the future.

            <p>After retrieving the policies from the PRP, the PDP determines what are the attributes needed by the policy rules to perform its evaluation. Some of those attributes can be determined from the request received (e.g., claims inside the Verifiable Credential(s) in the access token). But in general, the policy rules require additional attributes that have to be retrieved from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>The two logical sources of those attributes are the PIP and the Trusted Issuers Lists in the Trust Anchor Framework.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of the PIP is the same as in the standard XACML logical architecture, essentially enabling the PDP to retrieve environmental attributes required for policy evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>In our approach using Verifiable Credentials for authentication and authorization, we use a Trust Framework to determine if the credentials received in the request are issued by authorised issuers of those credentials.
            </p>
            <p>The PDP does not have hardcoded the actual Trusted Lists to query, but they are determined dynamically from the policies retrieved from the PRP. In simple use cases there may be one or two lists to query which are the same for all requests. But the mechanism described here can cater for very complex scenarios where the lists may be different depending on the requests and also from the dynamic environmental information retrieved from the PIP.

            <p>The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.
            </p>
            <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.
            </p>
            <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.
            </p>
            <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.
            </p>
            <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.
            </p>
            <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.
            </p>
            <p>For simplicity, the diagram below shows the query of the Trusted Issuer Lists as a single interaction to a single box, but the actual interactions can be very complex if required. In addition, the diagram does not specify whether the list is "private" or "global".

            <p>Authentic Sources are the public or private repositories or systems recognised or required by law containing attributes about a natural or legal persons.

            <p>The Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI of the [eIDAS2] legislative proposal are sources for attributes on address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, education and training qualifications titles and licences, professional qualifications titles and licences, public permits and licences, financial and company data.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI are required to provide interfaces to Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes  (QEAA) Providers to verify the authenticity of the above attributes, either directly or via designated intermediaries recognised at national level.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources may also issue (Q)EAA-s themselves if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. It is up to the Member States to define terms and conditions for the provisioning of these services, but according to the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of attributes.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In accordance to the policies, RealTruth made those validations when issuing the certificate to the COO, in such a way that the Relying Parties verifying the certificate can have a high level of trust in the assertion that the natural person identified in the certificate (with Spanish ID of 56565656V) is a legal representative of he GoodAir company (organizationIdentifier VATES-12345678).

In particular, this employee is going to be nominated as a LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative).
        </p>
        <p>As its name implies, the LEAR has to be nominated by a <b>legal representative</b> of the GoodAir organisation with the necessary legal authority to commit the organisation for this type of decision. In our case, the COO of GoodAir will nominate John Doe as the LEAR of GoodAir, delegating to him the capabilities to perform some processes in the DOME portal and some other tasks in other organisations. That means that John Doe will not be empowered to perform cation snot explicitly specified in the credential.
        </p>
        <p>To perform the nomination, the COO of GoodAir (a legal representative of GoodAir) will issue a special credential to John Doe and will sign the credential with his certificate for signatures as legal representative of GoodAir. The details are described later in this document.

        <p>DOME is a Data Space where local governments can procure data and services from other entities that act as service providers. At the same time, the local governments can also act as data and service providers for other entities in the Data Space.
        </p>
        <p>The DOME Data Space has an portal service that allows external entities to perform some processes in an automated fashion by using Verifiable Credentials that have been issued by trusted entities. The complete Trust Framework used by DOME is composed from a series of Trust Frameworks, some managed internally using a governance model of DOME and some others managed externally but by trusted entities. At the root of the Trust Framework of DOME is the eIDAS Trust Framework and the pan-european recognized list of Trust Service Providers issuing the eIDAS compliant digital identities, in the form of certificates for signatures/seals.
        </p>
        <p>In order to participate in DOME, every legal person requires a certificate for seals or that one of its legal representatives has a certificate for signatures (or both). The DOME entity is registered in France with VAT number <b>VATFR-99999999</b>.

<section id='request_scope'><h2>Request Scope</h2>

    <p>According to section 5.3 of [[OpenID.VP]], wallets MAY support requesting presentation of credentials using OAuth 2.0 <code>scope</code> values. Such a scope value MUST be an alias for a well-defined presentation definition as it will be referred to in the <code>presentation_submission</code> response parameter.

    <p>In this specification we define concrete scope values and the mapping between a certain scope value and the respective presentation definition, in particular the mapping between scope values and specific types of Verifiable Credentials used for access control in the use case described in this document. In a production implementation of a Data Space ecosystem, the Trust Framework has to define the mappings used in the ecosysyem and the mechanisms and governance model used to update those mappings.

    <p>In this example we only need the mapping for the LEARCredential, where the scope <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> represents the following presentation definition:
