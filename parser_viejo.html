<section><h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Once an organisation has onboarded an ecosystem like a Data Space, some of its employees have to be appointed to enable them to perform a concrete set of activities in the ecosystem. These activities are performed in the web portals of different organisations which are already participants in the ecosystem, like the onboarding service, the marketplace portals and also in the web portals of other participants.
    </p>
    <p>This document describes how:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id='list_140.1'>An organisation can issue Verifiable Credentials to its employees enabling them to perform some specific processes in other organisations "on-behalf-of" the employer        </li>
        <li id='list_140.2'>Other organisations can accept those Verifiable Credentials to perform authentication and access control.        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We assume that all organisations have onboarded in the ecosystem using the mechanisms described in [[[DID-ELSI]]] and [[[DID-ONBOARDING]]].
    </p>
    <p>The appointed employee will perform the process by using a special type of Verifiable Credential called <code>LEARCredential</code> (from <b>L</b>egal <b>E</b>ntity <b>A</b>ppointed <b>R</b>epresentative).
    </p>
    <p>To achieve a high level of legal certainty under eIDAS, the LEARCredential is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id='list_150.1'>signed or sealed with an eIDAS certificate which is either:        <div>
            <ul>
                <li id='list_153.1'>a <b>certificate for electronic seals</b> issued to a legal person by a Qualified Trust Service Provider, or                </li>
                <li id='list_153.2'>a <b>certificate for electronic signatures</b>, issued to a <b>legal representative of the legal person</b> by a Qualified Trust Service Provider.                </li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        </li>
        <li id='list_150.2'>signed using the <b>JSON Advanced Electronic Signature</b> format described in [[[ETSI-JADES]]]        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The LEARCredential includes claims identifying the employee and a description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.
    </p>
    <p>By signing/sealing the credential with an eIDAS certificate, the legal representative attests that the powers described in the credential have been delegated to the employee (maybe under some conditions, also described in the credential).
    </p>
    <p>In this way, the LEARCredential has the same legal status as any other document in other formats (e.g., PDF) signed in an eIDAS-compliant way, but with all the advantages provided by the Verifiable Credential format.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, the LEARCredential includes cryptographic material that allows the appointed employee to <b>use the credential as an online authentication mechanism</b> in a portal, by proving that the holder of the credential is the same person identified in the credential.
    </p>
    <p>Any Verifier that trusts the eIDAS Trust Framework will be able to verify that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id='list_168.1'><b>The person presenting the LEARCredential is the same as the one identified in the credential</b>        </li>
        <li id='list_168.2'><b>A legal representative of the organisation has attested that the person has the powers described in the credential</b>        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This enables the person presenting the LEARCredential to start the process and to provide any additional required documentation, preferably as additional Verifiable Credentials to enable automatic verification of compliance with the process requirements (including Gaia-X credentials issued by the Compliance Service of Gaia-X). 
    </p>
    <p>Both types of eIDAS certificates mentioned above are an electronic attestation <b>that links electronic seal/signature validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person</b>. This way, the certificate, usually linked to the sealed/signed document, can be used to verify the identity of the creator of the seal/signature and whether the document has been sealed/signed using the corresponding private key.
    </p>
    <p>Before issuing a certificate like the above, the Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) performs validations against `Authentic Sources` to authenticate the identity of the organisation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id='list_178.1'>The data concerning the business name or corporate name of the organisation.        </li>
        <li id='list_178.2'>The data relating to the constitution and legal status of the subscriber.        </li>
        <li id='list_178.3'>The data concerning the extent and validity of the powers of representation of the applicant.        </li>
        <li id='list_178.4'>The data concerning the tax identification code of the organisation or equivalent code used in the country to whose legislation the subscriber is subject.        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The person controlling the above certificates will appoint a legal entity representative (LEAR) by generating and signing a Verifiable Credential which:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id='list_186.1'>Includes identification data of an employee of the organisation        </li>
        <li id='list_186.2'>Includes claims stating the delegation of specific powers to perform a set of specific processes on behalf of the organisation        </li>
        <li id='list_186.3'>Includes a public key where the corresponding private key is controlled by the employee, enabling him to prove that he is the holder of the credential when it is being used in an authentication process like the ones used as examples in this document.        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The LEARCredential uses the `did:elsi` method for the identifiers of legal persons involved in the process, to facilitate the DID resolution and linkage with the eIDAS certificates. The `did:elsi` method is specified in [[[DID-ELSI]]].    
    </p>
    <p>The high-level view of the process is described in the following diagram, when a COO (Chief Operating Officer) appoints an employee to perform some processes:

<section><h2>Participants</h2>

    <p>Here we introduce the actors of the reference use case we are going to use. The main actors are marked in yellow in the following diagram.
    </p>
    <p>RealTruth is a Trust Service Provider operating under the eIDAS Trust Framework, which issues a certificate for seals to the company GoodAir. GoodAir is a business that provides some services using an Air Quality application operated by GoodAir.
    </p>
    <p>RealTruth also provides a certificate for signatures to the COO of the GoodAir company, so the COO can use the certificate to sign documents on behalf of GoodAir (like contracts, invoices, financial reports, ...) in a way that is compliant with eIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>The COO of GoodAir will issue a verifiable credential of type LEARCredential to an employee of GoodAir, signing the credential with his certificate for signatures.
    </p>

    <section id='participant'><h2>GoodAir: the company that wants to perform the process</h2>

        <p>The new participant is a business providing an Air Quality Monitoring application as a service. The business is called GoodAir and it operates the application, which receives data from a set of sensors that may or may not be the property of GoodAir. The sensors must have received a certification to be able to operate and send data to the GoodAir application.
        </p>
        <p>The company is registered in the tax agency and business registry of Spain with VAT number <b>VATES-12345678</b>.
        </p>
    </section>


    <section><h2>COO (Chief Operating Officer) of GoodAir</h2>

        <p>The GoodAir company is small and the only person that can sign contracts on behalf of the company is the COO (Chief Operating Officer). The COO is a legal representative of the company and she is registered as so in the business registry of Spain.
        </p>
        <p>The COO has a certificate for electronic signatures issued by one of the TSPs in Spain enabling the COO to perform electronic qualified signatures as legal representative of GoodAir, instead of doing them manually.
        </p>
        <p>The X.509 certificate of the COO has the following contents in the <code>Subject</code> field (the example below is derived from a real certificate but with the identifiers modified to be an example):

    <section><h2>RealTruth: a Trust Service Provider</h2>

        <p>RealTruth is an EU TSP, which appears in the TL (Trusted List) maintained by the <a href="https://tl.bundesnetzagentur.de/TL-DE.XML">German Government</a>.
        </p>
        <p>RealTruth is a TSP based in Germany but operates in most of the countries of the EU and so being able to provide Trust Services across many countries, including Spain.
        </p>
        <p>As all TSPs in the TLs of the Member States, its entry in the TL includes one or more "Services" entries which describe the Trust Services provided by the TSP.
        </p>
        <p>A TSP can have one Service issuing certificates for signatures, another service issuing certificates for seals, another service for timestamping, etc.
        </p>
        <p>The regulator approves or suspends each service from a TSP individually, and the services are the root anchor for a given trust environment.
        </p>
        <p>In our case, the entry for RealTruth in the TL includes a `&ltTSPService&gt` entry, and inside it the `&ltServiceDigitalIdentity&gt` entry includes a DER-encoded certificate specifying the digital identity of the root anchor for that trust domain.

        <p>RealTruth provides `Legal Person Representative Certificates` which are qualified in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.
        </p>
        <p>The certification policies of RealTruth includes the following sentences:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The Registration Authority must verify the following information in order to authenticate the identity of the organisation:
            </p>
            <ul>

        <p>The TSP (RealTruth in this case) performs the verifications against `Authentic Sources`.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Authentic Sources are the public or private repositories or systems recognised or required by law containing attributes about a natural or legal persons.

            <p>The Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI of the [eIDAS2] legislative proposal are sources for attributes on address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, education and training qualifications titles and licences, professional qualifications titles and licences, public permits and licences, financial and company data.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI are required to provide interfaces to Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes  (QEAA) Providers to verify the authenticity of the above attributes, either directly or via designated intermediaries recognised at national level.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources may also issue (Q)EAA-s themselves if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. It is up to the Member States to define terms and conditions for the provisioning of these services, but according to the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of attributes.

        <p>In accordance to the policies, RealTruth made those validations when issuing the certificate to the COO, in such a way that the Relying Parties verifying the certificate can have a high level of trust in the assertion that the natural person identified in the certificate (with Spanish ID of 56565656V) is a legal representative of he GoodAir company (organizationIdentifier VATES-12345678).

    <section><h2>John Doe: an administrative employee of GoodAir</h2>

        <p>This is an employee of the central administration department of GoodAir, who is going to be formally nominated to manage a specific set of processes on behalf of GoodAir in the Data Space. In particular, this employee is going to be nominated as a LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative).
        </p>
        <p>As its name implies, the LEAR has to be nominated by a <b>legal representative</b> of the GoodAir organisation with the necessary legal authority to commit the organisation for this type of decision. In our case, the COO of GoodAir will nominate John Doe as the LEAR of GoodAir, delegating to him the capabilities to perform some processes in the DOME portal and some other tasks in other organisations. That means that John Doe will not be empowered to perform cation snot explicitly specified in the credential.
        </p>
        <p>To perform the nomination, the COO of GoodAir (a legal representative of GoodAir) will issue a special credential to John Doe and will sign the credential with his certificate for signatures as legal representative of GoodAir. The details are described later in this document.
        </p>

    <section><h2>DOME: an instance of a Data Space for Smart Cities</h2>

        <p>DOME is a Data Space where local governments can procure data and services from other entities that act as service providers. At the same time, the local governments can also act as data and service providers for other entities in the Data Space.
        </p>
        <p>The DOME Data Space has an portal service that allows external entities to perform some processes in an automated fashion by using Verifiable Credentials that have been issued by trusted entities. The complete Trust Framework used by DOME is composed from a series of Trust Frameworks, some managed internally using a governance model of DOME and some others managed externally but by trusted entities. At the root of the Trust Framework of DOME is the eIDAS Trust Framework and the pan-european recognized list of Trust Service Providers issuing the eIDAS compliant digital identities, in the form of certificates for signatures/seals.
        </p>
        <p>In order to participate in DOME, every legal person requires a certificate for seals or that one of its legal representatives has a certificate for signatures (or both). The DOME entity is registered in France with VAT number <b>VATFR-99999999</b>.

<section><h2>The LEARCredential</h2>

    <p>We use here a LEARCredential, described in detail in [[DID-ONBOARDING]], with different roles and duties embedded into the credential. The credential enables the employee (or subcontractor) to perform a specific sets of processes in the ecosystem, including interacting with other organisations in the ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>We describe here the differences with respect to the example presented in [[DID-ONBOARDING]], to show how organisations can use LEARCredentials to enable secure, efficient, scalable and decentralised IAM (Identity and Access Management) to enable access to protected resources.
    </p>
    <p>The process of generation of the credential is the same, where the legal representative of the organisation will use his eIDAS certificate to sign the credential.
    </p>
    <p>The credential will be generated with an application that the COO will use as VC Issuer and that allows the employee to receive the credential using his credential wallet, using [[OpenID.VCI]] to achieve compliance with the EUDI Wallet ARF.
    </p>
    <p>The application enables the COO to specify the information required to create the LEARCredential, specifying the employee information and the specific type of LEARCredential. In general, there may be different instances of LEARCredentials for different purposes. One employee can have more than one LEARCredential, each having a different delegation of powers for different environments.
    </p>

    <section><h2>Claims identifying the employee</h2>

        <p>These are claims identifying the subject of the credential, the person who will act as LEAR. Each Data Space can define their own depending on their specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, each organisation can specify their own for enabling access to its products/services. However, it is advisable to do this only when it is strictly required, and it is recommended to use a set of claims that are agreed upon by all participants in the ecosystem. This includes not only the amount of claims but also their syntax and semantics.
        </p>
        <p>An example set of claims is the following:
        </p>

<section><h2>Authenticating with the LEARCredential</h2>


    <section><h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The diagram below is describes the high level logical architecture that we will be use as a reference for the detailed explanations in the next sections.
        </p>
        <p>The diagram uses the logical concepts also used in the XACML reference architecture, but the description is agnostic to the actual policy language used in a concrete implementation.
        </p>
        <p>In this description we assume that the user is a natural person who wants to access a protected resource. However, the architecture support machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. The differences will be described in the description when they are relevant.
        </p>

        <figure><img src='images/login_in_DOME/authn_architecture_numbered.drawio.png'/>
        <figcaption>Architecture overview </figcaption></figure>

        <p>We assume here that the user sends a request to perform a protected operation, which we define as any operation that requires authorisation.
        </p>
        <p>An example is an operation on resources controlled by Company A, where Company A allows a subset of employees of Company B to perform the operation. Another similar example is when Company A allows a subset of machines/devices of Company B to perform the operation.
        </p>
        <p>There are several high level scenarios which are possible:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li id='list_737.1'>The user navigates first to a general Login page in the portal of the Relying Party and authenticates. After authentication the portal presents a collection of services that the user can access. The user selects one of the services/operations and the Relying Party executes the operation if the user is authorised to do so.            </li>
            <li id='list_737.2'>The user tries to access the protected resource directly (maybe using a specific URL, or invoking and endpoint with input data identifying the resource).            <div>
                <p>If the user is not authenticated, the system will reject the request. If the user is a natural person accessing the portal via an Internet browser, the typical approach is to redirect the browser to the Login page using an HTTP Status of 302. The redirection includes enough information so the authentication component can send back the user to the original request if the user completes authentication successfully.
                </p>
                <p>If the user is a machine using an API, the system can simply reject the request or reject it including information in the response that the caller can interpret to perform the login and retry.
                </p>
            </div>
            </li>
        </ul>

    </section>


    <section><h2>Starting the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow</h2>

        <p>In this section we assume that the user tries to access a protected resource and that the user is not authenticated. The flow when the user is already authenticated is the same, just skipping the authentication phase (steps 1 to 6).
        </p>
        <p>The authentication process starts an OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification [[OpenID.SIOP2]], where the VC Verifier component of the portal plays the role of a Relying Party (RP in Open ID Connect terminology) and the wallet of the user is a Self-Issued IdP.
        </p>
        <p>In this step, the Verifier has to send an Authorization Request to the wallet. But as a Self-Issued OP may be running locally as a native application or progressive web application (PWA), the RP may not have a network-addressable endpoint to communicate directly with the OP. We have to leverage the implicit flow of OpenID Connect to communicate with such locally-running Ops, as described in [[OpenID.SIOP2]].
        </p>
        <p>We use a QR code to start the process and allow the wallet to receive the Authorization Request from the Verifier, and respond with an Authorization Response, sent to the Verifier in the body of an HTTP <code>POST</code> request.
        </p>

    <section><h2>Generating the Authorization Request</h2>

        <p>The Authorization Request travels in the response to the HTTP GET request performed in the previous point, as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service.
        </p>
        <p>The parameters comprising a request for verifiable presentations are given in section 5 of [[OpenID.VP]] and in section 10.1 of [[OpenID.SIOP2]] and are reproduced here with the particularities of this use case, in particular that this is a cross-device interaction:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li id='list_832.response_type'><a href='#list_832.response_type' class='selfref'><b>response_type</b></a> REQUIRED. Must be <code>vp_token</code>. This parameter is defined in [[RFC6749]]> The possible values are determined by the response type registry established by [[RFC6749]]. The [[OpenID.VP]] specification introduces the response type <code>vp_token</code>. This response type asks the SIOP to return only a VP Token in the Authorization Response, which is what we want in our case.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.scope'><a href='#list_832.scope' class='selfref'><b>scope</b></a> REQUIRED. This parameter is defined in [[RFC6749]] which allows it to be used by verifiers to request presentation of credentials by utilizing a pre-defined scope value designating the type of credential. See section <a href="#request_scope" class="xref">Request Scope</a> for more details. We use in this instance the value <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> which means that the RP (DOME onboarding service) is asking the SIOP (user wallet) to send a credential of type <code>LEARCredential</code>.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.response_mode'><a href='#list_832.response_mode' class='selfref'><b>response_mode</b></a> REQUIRED. MUST be <code>direct_post</code>. As this is a cross-device scenario, this response mode is used to instruct the Self-Issued OP to deliver the result of the authentication process to a certain endpoint using the HTTP POST method. This endpoint to which the SIOP shall deliver the authentication result is conveyed in the parameter <code>redirect_uri</code> described below.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.redirect_uri'><a href='#list_832.redirect_uri' class='selfref'><b>redirect_uri</b></a> (REQUIRED). MUST be a valid RP endpoint. The Authentication Response is sent to this endpoint using <code>POST</code> and encoding `application/json`).                </li>
                <li id='list_832.client_id'><a href='#list_832.client_id' class='selfref'><b>client_id</b></a> REQUIRED. MUST be the DID of the RP (DOM onboarding entity) so it can be resolved by the SIOP and checked against a Trusted List, or rejected if it does not pass validation. This provides a high level of assurance to the SIOP that the RP is really who it claims.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.client_id_scheme'><a href='#list_832.client_id_scheme' class='selfref'><b>client_id_scheme</b></a> REQUIRED. MUST have the value <code>did</code>. This value indicates that the Client Identifier is a DID defined in [[DID-Core]]. The request MUST be signed with a private key associated with the DID. To obtain the corresponding private key, the Wallet MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method used by the Verifier. For most DID methods and since the associated DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the kid in the JOSE Header. However, in our case the Verifier uses `did:elsi` and so the request MUST be signed with the eIDAS certificate according to the [[ETSI-JADES]] format, which defines the mechanism to identify the public key.                <div>
                    <p>All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the client_metadata or the `client_metadata_uri parameter` as defined in Section 5 of [[OpenID.VP]].
                    </p>
                </div>
                </li>
                <li id='list_832.nonce'><a href='#list_832.nonce' class='selfref'><b>nonce</b></a> REQUIRED. This parameter follows the definition given in [[OpenID.Core]]. It is used to securely bind the verifiable presentation(s) provided by the wallet (SIOP) to the particular transaction managed by the RP.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.state'><a href='#list_832.state' class='selfref'><b>state</b></a> REQUIRED. Used by the portal component of DOM onboarding to associate the start of an authentication session with the end of that session when the RP Verifier component notifies to the portal.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.presentation_definition'><a href='#list_832.presentation_definition' class='selfref'><b>presentation_definition</b></a> CONDITIONAL. A string containing a <code>presentation_definition</code> JSON object as defined in Section 4 of [[DIF.PresentationExchange]]. We do not use this parameter because <code>scope</code> already specifies the credential type.                </li>
                <li id='list_832.presentation_definition_uri'><a href='#list_832.presentation_definition_uri' class='selfref'><b>presentation_definition_uri</b></a> CONDITIONAL. A string containing a URL pointing to a resource where a <code>presentation_definition</code> JSON object as defined in Section 4 of [[DIF.PresentationExchange]] can be retrieved. We do not use this parameter because <code>scope</code> already specifies the credential type.                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note: A request MUST contain either a <code>presentation_definition</code> or a <code>presentation_definition_uri</code> or a single <code>scope</code> value representing a presentation definition, those three ways to request credential presentation are mutually exclusive. We use here the <code>scope</code> mechanism, which is simpler and fits our use case.
            </p>
            <p>This is an example request:

    <section><h2>Verification of the Authorization Request</h2>

        <p>Before sending the Authentication Response, the wallet should verify that the Authorization Request is correct. The most important verifications are described here:
        </p>
        <figure><img src='builtassets/diagram_cd247bef8d0d1b9695077620dfe77208.svg' alt=''>

        <ul>
            <li id='list_960.10'><a href='#list_960.10' class='selfref'><b>10</b></a> Verification of the signature. As mentioned in the previous section, the Authorization Request is received as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service. This allows the wallet to verify that the signature corresponds to a real-world entity.            </li>
            <li id='list_960.11'><a href='#list_960.11' class='selfref'><b>11</b></a> Verification that the DID in the <code>client_id</code> field of the Authorization Request corresponds to the entity that signed the Authorization Request. This is easy in our case because we use the `did:elsi` method.            </li>
            <li id='list_960.12'><a href='#list_960.12' class='selfref'><b>12</b></a> Verification that the entity identified in the <code>client_id</code> field of the Authorization Request is a trusted entity belonging to the ecosystem, by resolving the DID of in the <code>client_id</code> field.            <div>
                <p>The actual mechanism may vary depending on the DID method used and the ecosystem where the client wants to onboard. In the case of DOME, the DOME onboarding service is a well-known entity and it is easy to verify that the DID corresponds to the DOME onboarding service.
                </p>
                <p>In the case that the Relying Party is a participant in the ecosystem, we assume that the ecosystem provides a Trusted Participants Registry with an API compatible with the EBSI Trusted Issuers Registry, and that the participants registry is managed in a trusted way by the DOME onboarding service.
                </p>
                <p>In this case, to check if the DID is a participant on the DOME ecosystem, the wallet sends a `GET /api/did/v1/identifiers/did:elsi:VATFR-9999999` request to the endpoint of one of several trusted servers implementing the query Trusted Participant Registry functionality. The API returns a JSON document as a DID Document DID Document. The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owner of the DID. It contains its Public Key, used to verify the digital signature of the entity. It also contains the status of the entity in the DOME ecosystem. It is extensible and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case. The API must be operated by a trusted entity for the user. There may be as many servers implementing the API as needed and operated by different entities. At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the wallet of the user.
                </p>

    <section><h2>Creating and sending the Authentication Response </h2>

        <p>Once the Authorization Request has been validated, the wallet creates an Authentication Response to be posted in the <code>redirect_uri</code> specified by GoodAir in the Authorization Request. The complete process from reception of Authorization Request until sending the Authorization Response is described in the diagram below.
        </p>

        </ul>

    </section>


    <section><h2>Authenticating the user with the LEARCredential</h2>

        <p>We should remember that inside the LEARCredential the <code>credentialSubject</code> object has an <code>id</code> field with value `did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK` which is the DID of the user. It was generated during the creation of the LEARCredential, and the Relying Party should trust that the credential was generated in the proper way binding cryptographically the DID with the LEARCredential, as described in a previous section. It is the same trust that should be put in the generation of any other signed document, like a contract or invoice.
        </p>
        <p>The process of verifying the Authorization Response and authenticating the user with the LEARCredential is the following:
        </p>
        <figure><img src='builtassets/diagram_ee51b56847b12e7035ab84cfc7de2965.svg' alt=''>

In order to verify that the Verifiable Credential has been issued by a trusted entity, the Relying Party has to verify:            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li id='list_1098.1'>That the DID of the entity which is the issuer of the VC is a trusted entity.                    </li>
                    <li id='list_1098.2'>That the VC was signed by that participant.                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Both verifications can be done by performing DID resolution, checking that the resulting DID Document contains the public key corresponding to the one specified in the Verifiable Credential, and by verifying the digital signature of the credential against that public key.
                </p>
                <p>In our case the LEARCredential was issued using the `did:elsi` method, so resolution is very simple and is specified in [[DID-ELSI]].
                </p>
            </div>
            </li>
            <li id='list_1095.17'><a href='#list_1095.17' class='selfref'><b>17</b></a> After verifying the credential, the Relying Party can also verify that the Verifiable Presentation including the Verifiable Credential is sent by the user and not by a malicious agent. To do so, it uses the public key associated to the `did:key` identifier <code>id</code> field inside the <code>credentialSubject</code> structure. That public key is cryptographically bound to the customer DID during the onboarding process that GoodAir performed with its employee.            </li>
            <li id='list_1095.18'><a href='#list_1095.18' class='selfref'><b>18</b></a> The Verifier creates an Access Token for the user so he can use it to access services in the DOME onboarding portal. The Access Token is generated in JWT format and signed by the RP component. The access token is intended for use as bearer token over HTTP [[RFC2616]] using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [[RFC5246]] to access protected resources, and it should use the JWT Profile profile described in [[RFC9068]].            <div>
                <p>For our use case, the payload of the JWT access token looks like:

<section id='request_scope' class='appendix'><h2>Request Scope</h2>

    <p>According to section 5.3 of [[OpenID.VP]], wallets MAY support requesting presentation of credentials using OAuth 2.0 <code>scope</code> values. Such a scope value MUST be an alias for a well-defined presentation definition as it will be refered to in the <code>presentation_submission</code> response parameter.
    </p>
    <p>In this specification we define concrete scope values and the mapping between a certain scope value and the respective presentation definition, in particular the mapping between scope values and specific types of Verifiable Credentials used for access control in the use case described in this document. In a production implementation of a Data Space ecosystem, the Trust Framework has to define the mappings used in the ecosysyem and the mechanisms and governance model used to update those mappings.
    </p>
    <p>In this example we only need the mapping for the LEARCredential, where the scope <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> represents the following presentation definition:

<section><h2>Access control with the LEARCredential</h2>

    <p>Once the user has performed authentication and the portal displays the services that he has available, the user clicks on a specific service that he wants to access.
    </p>
    <p>If the Relying Party (the portal) is the DOME Onboarding service, this could be the onboarding service itself, or a service to upload additional information for a partially completed onboarding process.
    </p>
    <p>If the RP is the Marketplace and the organisation wants to offer products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Seller</i>, or to create a Product specification and offering.
    </p>
    <p>If the RP is the Marketplace and the organisation wants to contract products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Customer</i>, or to launch a procurement order of a product.
    </p>
    <p>The same mechanism can be used by any participant in the ecosystem, if they want to use an advanced IAM mechanism which is aligned with the EU strategy on digital identity based on Verifiable Credential and eIDAS2.
    </p>
    <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure from [[[NIST-AUTH]]] which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve enforcement the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.

The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded if they are accepted.        </li>
        <li id='list_1278.3'><a href='#list_1278.3' class='selfref'><b>3</b></a> The PEP requests a decision from the PEP. The request from the PEP to the PDP consists of subject attributes (typically for the user who issued the request), resource attributes (the resource for which access is sought), action attributes (the operations to be performed on the resource), and environment attributes.        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some of the above attributes are obtained by the PEP from the original request received from the browser. For example, the HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the URL and possibly the body of the request provide action attributes.
    </p>
    <p>The access token generated during authentication provides some subject attributes (identification data and roles assigned by the issuer of the credential).

    <p>Environmental attributes, which depend on the availability of system sensors that can detect and report values, are somewhat different from subject and resource attributes, which are administratively created. Environmental attributes are not properties of the subject or resources, but are measurable characteristics that pertain to the operational or situational context in which access requests occur. These environmental characteristics are subject and resource independent, and may include the current time, day of the week, or threat level.
    </p>
    <p>The PDP computes decisions to permit or deny subject requests to perform actions on resources. In computing a decision, the PDP queries policies stored in a PRP.
    </p>
    <p>If the attributes of the request are not sufficient for rule and policy evaluation, the PDP may need to search the PIP for additional attributes. The PIP is shown as one logical store, but in fact may comprise multiple physical stores of different types. In our case, the logical PIP includes one or more Trusted Issuers Lists (to check if the issuer of the credential is included in them as a trusted issuer of that type of credential), and also the Authorization Registry (AR), which can check for finer granularity authorisation records which may be very dynamic in nature (e.g. if some resource usage by employees and machines owned by the issuer have exceeded some quota this month).
    </p>
    <p>The actual Trusted Issuers Lists that the PDP needs to check is determined by the policy rules retrieved from the PRP. Those policy rules also determine the additional queries performed to the PIP data stores.
    </p>
    <p>The set of information and data stored in the PIP and PRP comprise the access control data and collectively define the current authorization state, which the PDP will use to compute its decision.
