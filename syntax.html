<h1 class="no-num"> rite Syntax</h1>

<h1><span class='secno'>1</span>  This is a test</h1>

<p>The core of <code>rite</code> syntax  is essentially semantic HTML5 with some simplifications to make it easier to write. It also allows a reduced set of Markdown features, described below.
</p>
<p>The most important concept in <code>rite</code> is that indentation is relevant for the structure of the document. Indentation is used to eliminate the need to use the end tags.
</p>
<h2><span class='secno'>1.1</span> The structure of a document</h2>

<p>A 'rite' document MAY start with a metadata header denoted by a line of minimum three dashes, where the <code>title</code> item is compulsory. Like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: Syntax for Rite
---</code></pre>

<h2><span class='secno'>1.2</span> Block syntax</h2>

<p>In Rite indentation is relevant, making the document source much easier to understand. The meaning of <i>relevant</i> is the same as in Python, Markdown lists or even natural language.
</p>
<p>Block structure is evident from the indentation of the text and takes priority over inline structure.
</p>
<p>Items of the same block are separated from one another by blank lines. For a given block item, all contiguos lines are processed as a single paragraph. Processing of paragraphs is explained below.
</p>
<p>A line which is indented more than the previous one starts a new, indented block.
</p>
<h2><span class='secno'>1.3</span> Headers</h2>

<p>A header can be written in two ways, HTML and Rite way.
