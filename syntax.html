<h1><span class='secno'>1</span>  Rite Syntax</h1>

<h2><span class='secno'>1.1</span>  Block syntax</h2>

<p>In Rite indentation is relevant, making the document source much easier to understand. The meaning of <i>relevant</i> is the same as in Python, Markdown lists or even natural language.
</p>
<p>Block structure is evident from the indentation of the text and takes priority over inline structure.
</p>
<p>Items of the same block are separated from one another by blank lines. For a given block item, all contiguos lines are processed as a single paragraph. Processing of paragraphs is explained below.
</p>
<p>A line which is indented more than the previous one starts a new, indented block.
</p>
<h2><span class='secno'>1.2</span>  Headers</h2>

<p>A header can be written in two ways, HTML and Rite way.
